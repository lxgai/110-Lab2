        As a <b>2nd year CS major</b> at UCSD, part of why I chose to this major was due to my interest in how technology has helped broaden connections with people all over the world. Even in a pandemic we still can communicate and connect, even if at most through a screen.

          <h3>Music</h3>
          <p>
            Sometimes I spend my free time listening to music from a lot of different artists.
          </p>
          <aside>
            <p>
              Since middle school, a lot of the artists came from KPOP.
            </p>
          </aside>
          <p>
            Here's a list of musical artists that I've been enjoying recently:
          </p>
          
          <ol>
            <li>EXO</li>
            <li>The Neighborhood</li>
            <li>(G)I-DLE</li>
            <li>Zayn</li>
            <li>Ed Sheeran</li>
          </ol>
          
          <p> I met you when I was a teen<br>
            But then you were one as well<br>
            And I could play the guitar just like ringing a bell
          </p>
          <p>"Nina", by Ed Sheeran</p>

          <h3>Travel</h3>
          <p>
            Currently, I have visited many different cities in China (including Shanghai, Beijing, Hangzhou, Xiamen, etc.). I have also visited New York, Washington D.C., and Vancouver.
          </p>

          <p>
            In the future, I hope to visit Seoul, South Korea and Tokyo, Japan. It would also be cool to tour Europe and see cities like London, Venice, and Paris.
